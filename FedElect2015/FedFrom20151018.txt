shut out by @justintrudeau to @_andrewleslie proud to be on #teamtrudeau w such accomplished candidates working for #realchange #macdebate
amazing to be watching #macdebate with over 60 members of our awesome team this is what #realchange looks like
@justintrudeau is killing it
jam packed room at our #macdebate party need for overflow room join us at westboro clocktower #ottawacentre #lpc
#lpc focus is progressive policies that reach cdns who need it most child benefit middle class tax cut #macdebate
very important point by @justintrudeau #ndp federal min wage is misleading applies to only 1 of cdns making min wage #macdebate
canvass team is so big it's getting tricky to take a selfie #realchange in actionoff to watch #macdebate #elxn42

bonne discussion avec @gillestaillon ce soir @justintrudeau parlera de ce qui est important pr les canadiens #elxn42
looking forward to more of this tonight @justintrudeau talking to canadians about our plan for #realchange #elxn42
quite love my @ottawasuncom horoscope from yesterday
#lpc focus is on broad practical progressive policies that reach cdns who need it most cda child benefit middle class tax cut #elxn42
@rabnew picking on people who are working hard don't have time to read fine print of #ndp's minimum wage promise is hardly fair #elxn42
it is misleading when many cdns think they would benefit from #ndp's minimum wage promise but won't #elxn42

@steve_rennie @jsmarier thank you for the follows
the writ has dropped so excited for our campaign to continue throughout the summer look out for myself and
i'm not a pollster but this reflects what i am hearing at the doors the people of ottawa south want mr harper
it is time to move forward on this
today after several hours of canvassing i had the pleasure of meeting with the palestinian canadian community
no much i can ad his record speaks for itself
this plan makes sense after the massive cuts to the social and health transfers by both the liberals and the
one other rule have fun
i am very honored to be working with young leaders in the ottawa south muslim community
great day at the elimu barbecue raising some funds for education in kenya and meeting some old friends i need
i invite public servants in ottawa south to get involved in my campaign if you want real change then the ndp
we have a fiscally responsible economic plan to build an economy for the 21st century mr harper's plan is
we will be making a concerted effort to get this information to the voters in ottawa south stay tuned for more
just got in from canvassing did i miss anything
mr trudeau this is about making a difference in the lives of hard working canadians across the country i am
will pvr it canvassing is more important
just back from canvassing voters in ottawa south are #ready4change
the ndp believe in public service and public servants
give us time we can some up with some more descriptors
yes join my campaign in ottawa south if you want to beat mr harper then the progressive and strategic choice
you know i see the liberal slogan real change and then i look at their support for c 51 keystone
@millerro hi sorry i missed responding the shooting last night was outside my mom's place happy to oblige when ever it works for you
and with 11 weeks we have more time to get the truth out thanks stephen
my political journey it has taken me a while but i am so pleased and proud to be the ndp nominee in ottawa
@anaisvoski actually we were planning to start to canvas today we see this as a marathon not a sprint
having a great afternoon connecting with supporters in ottawa south #gameon #ottcity #election2015
the writ has been dropped my team is hitting the doors today #ottcity #ndp
we have a plan for this stay tuned
there is an old expression you can run but you can't hide this extended campaign will cause a strain on all

@kinburnsheep we need an economic strategy plan for the long term that is developed collaboratively with all the related sectors included

to be fair justin actually has a good point with this comment #elxn42
great to see andy wang's team doorknocking in barrhaven
trudeau said the budget will balance itself and now he says he can't balance it at all
@pmharper has cut taxes for people earning less than 30 000 by almost 100 #elxn42 #macdebate
moms dads are best positioned to decide what their kids need for back to school shopping #uccb will help #elxn42
@eycanada says consumers will have additional disposable income boosted by the recent #uccb payments #elxn42
icymi @eycanada says canadian back to school spending set to increase 4 #uccb #elxn42
reminder personal income tax savings by family income under @pmharpers leadership #elxn42
it's back jobs for tradespeople renos for homeowners savings for taxpayers pm's home renovation tax credit
scary
would you entrust your money to a gov that wasted 1b on gas plant it never opened justin would he backs wynne's 1k tax on every worker

wynne admits her payroll tax will cost a small business w 10 workers 10 000 more trudeau will implement that tax nationwide #trudeautax
ontario's budget says trudeau wynne plan will cost everyone earning 60k over 1 000 in new payroll tax hikes #elxn42
justin has said he wants a mandatory expansion of the cpp of the type kathleen wynne put forward in ontario may 28 2015 #elxn42
not surprised wynne is campaigning for justin she needs him in ottawa as he wont oppose her high tax schemes #elxn42
reminder our gov made elections cheaper by eliminating per vote subsidy despite the opposition's howling #elxn42
wynne mcguinty hiked taxes on families added more debt than all previous on premiers combined now wynne lectures others on spending #elxn42
one leader is just not ready another we can't afford the choice is clear let's stick with proven leadership #elxn42
@jrward77 @davidmcguinty you bet he is i was honoured to have such an excellent mp at our launch

justin trudeau wants a payroll tax hike on every worker rt to say no to the #trudeautax
vous voulez garder plus ou moins de votre argent #orpp #elxn42
would you entrust your money to a gov that wasted 1b on gas plant it never opened justin would he backs wynne's 1k tax on every worker
according to wynne's budget the trudeau plan will cost every worker earning 60k annually over 1 000 in new tax
given ontario gov's record of managing money one wonders whether any money will even be there for canadians 40 years from now #elxn42 #orpp
justin wants a mandatory expansion of the cpp of the type kathleen wynne put forward in ontario may 28 2015 #orpp #elxn42

incredible that mulcair would be singing thatcher's praises in 2001 the uk labour movement has never recovered from her rule #elxn42

great chats w @carleton_u students at their clubs day today love how many think #apathyisboring #lpc #realchange
@stewartcattroll awesome i appreciate your vote
@2015inthehouse refusing to do the woman's debate sent a message to a lot of women about mulcair's priorities @nstdenis @justintrudeau
@2015inthehouse totally agree we can all do better hoping we reach gender parity soon @nstdenis @justintrudeau @ottawacitizen
@johnefrancis yes it was @justintrudeau's response to a question by @michaelrwoods after his comments this am
also @justintrudeau noted that while he agreed to a debate on women's issues @thomasmulcair @pmharper won't participate #upfordebate
@justintrudeau liberal gov't will ensure gender parity in appointments in cabinet we need more women's voices it's 2015 4 4
@justintrudeau #lpc gov't will provide national leadership call inquiry into missing murdered indigenous women to end this violence
@justintrudeau #lpc will make largest new infrastructure investment including safer women's shelters affordable housing 2 4
proud of answer that @justintrudeau gave to @michaelrwoods about what #lpc will do about women's shelters making ottawa safer 4 women 1 4
#ottawa has an affordable housing crisis needs much greater investments in public transit only a #lpc govt will seriously tackle these
setting up for @justintrudeau's response to today's economic update #elxn42 #lpc
so in the end only 2 ottawa tories attend mayor's makeup meeting is ottawa still not a priority for #cpc #elxn42
@bbclysedoucet true but i always have time to hear your take on what's going on in the world you make me very proud to be canadian
welcome to ottawa @bbclysedoucet it's always incredible to hear your perspective on world events wish i could join your talk tonight

@hurricanehendy how will i be diff in that regard by showing up responding to critics such as yourself by thinking speaking for myself
@hurricanehendy have stated that they will refuse to engage in debates or speak to the media during this election that's not democratic
@hurricanehendy but you have to understand that from my pov we must be critical of the fact that our governing party and its candidates
@hurricanehendy in the meantime why not check out and for a lot more about who i am
@hurricanehendy i have two local newspapers which will run letters i'm writing in the next several days and that should give you a sense
@hurricanehendy i've said and shown a lot that's positive which demonstrates the kind of person i am search through my fb posts
@hurricanehendy hi brad you're right but it's a challenge at times to put aside what i'm angry at keep focus on what i'm hopeful for
challenge to @andywang_ca will you join us at debates or does #harper have you on a short leash as well #democracy

we're going all the way this time and we're taking conservatives and liberals of conscience with us
a candidate who refuses to answer your questions about his party's policies does not deserve your vote period

@jigglypants44 wish i could say it was strategic but do love the sales
super smart advice for today
waiting until the last minute to do back to school shopping may have been a strategic error
beyond belief
this para in @m_ignatieff's piece is spot on time to rise to the occasion #syrianrefugees
excellent piece by @m_ignatieff in today's @nytimes the refugee crisis isn't a 'european problem' #syrianrefugees
a poorer smaller canada took in 60 000 vietnamese #refugees in 2 yrs in 70s 35 000 hungarians in late 1950s need political will #syria
incredible to see cdns across cda calling for govt to take in more syrian #refugees now it's not about partisanship but doing what's right
#lpc urgent plan for #syrian refugees bring in 25 000 govt sponsored now private more capacity on ground 100 mil to unhcr wfp #elxn42
@stevebeckta i love it especially the mode of transport happy anniversary
i love #imwhathappens if you haven't seen it already check it out refugees help build our great country
amazing to see mayors across the country step up #syria #refugees
great to see lawyers' #billable hour appeal for #syria take off in canada let's do this @cba_news @lawsocietylsuc
this is an awesome initiative
time to end the bureaucratic nightmare and let #syrian refugees in

this is heartening #humanitywashedashore
sign theft is very frustrating we will get you a new one asap please email signs@catherinemckenna ca
@gmbutts thanks proud to be on an incredible team @marcgarneau @viraniarif @johnmccallumlpc @janephilpott @nirmalanaidoo #teamtrudeau
will definitely be joining #samarachat on wednesday at noon you should too #apathyisboring #ownyourdemocracy
leadership starts at the top harper gov't can get things done in a hurry when it wants to no political will here
it's about who we are and what we want to continue to be watch @justintrudeau speak about syria #refugee crisis
infuriating because of bureaucracy a group applying to sponsor a syrian family would never be successful #elxn42
what you can do w political will in 1980 under joe clark 6200 vietnamese were processed in 1 month #elxn42
own your democracy vote now in #ottawacentre at returning office on carling by preston old dow honda dealer
last words to @oldbakerman goodnight
while #cpc's lack of empathy action wrt syria #refugee crisis is appalling proud of cdns calling for us to do more #humanitywashedashore
see @telfordk more @votecatherine team members knocking at doors to celebrate your birthday thanks team #lpc
huge birthday wishes to the amazing @telfordk your positive we can do this attitude inspires all of us to @goknockdoors every day
great launch for a great book written by a great canadian thanks @bobrae48 and hi to your lovely daughters
speaking of the hardest working team here are some of my amazing team members hard at work #grateful
@sarahkirby3 thanks sarah i'm lucky to have the most innovative and hardest working team
as @bobrae48 put it @justintrudeau is working for deep real change on critical issues proud 2 be on #teamtrudeau to help make it happen
always incredible to hear @bobrae48 his call to action to change the way we do politics for the better resonates
harper government needs to respond with humanity too #humanitywashedashore
looking forward to introducing @bobrae48 tonight at his ottawa book launch hosted by @pearsoncentre #ottcity
great to see @jimwatsonottawa commit that ottawa will help if the federal government chooses to let more #refugees settle in canada

this isn't about the harper govt's approach to one particular #refugee case it's about its lack of compassion serious action #elxn42
@kates_uottawa sadly not today but will be doing it next week in westboro stay tuned
this requires a lot more than talk expressions of concern canada needs to act now #refugees
but we also need to tackle the complex issues causing our global #refugee crisis only true solution is peace and prosperity
canada can and should do more working with western countries we can have a dramatic impact by taking more #refugees funding unhcr
when i worked for the un in east timor i saw very committed and thoughtful canadians working in all of these areas #refugees
6 it means negotiating with other countries to ensure safe return and addressing population that does not want to return #refugees
5 it means bringing perpetrators to justice while fostering healing #refugees
4 it means helping with reintegration where perpetrators of violence often live side by side by with victims #refugees
3 it means addressing the trauma suffered including seeing friends relatives die or being killed girls women raped #refugees
2 it means ensuring that it is safe for #refugees and #idps to return
1 addressing #refugee crises is much more than just resettling people providing for their basic needs
i saw the horrible price that refugees pay the lessons i learned from this experience have stuck with me
when i worked for un mission in east timor 1 3 of population was #refugees or idps this informed every decision we made
canada needs a serious long term strategy so we can play our part in addressing the refugee crisis and dealing with conflict zones #elxn42
we need a grown up conversation about canada's role in the world we are a rich country we can should be doing a lot more #elxn42
chris alexander blames the media for the harper government's inaction and indifference the worst
this is what chris alexander should do
beyond words

a #nepean voter asked if he'll see me in a debate i'll debate but my #cpc #liberal foes won't confirm their participation #badpolitics
@jerstowe i'd love to debate i've heard of 2 debates in #nepean @andywang_ca has declined both @chandranepean is not confirming 1 of them

@peacegurila hi lubabah please email me at sean devine@ndp ca thanks
thank you @barrhavenblog @nepeanndp today was a great but sad day of listening to others like @jimwatsonottawa and his smart staff
@wherewarlives i agree it's worth putting politics aside so that we can be #humanitarian when it is needed most
@vandnabhatia1 this is a global crisis that has not even reached its peak and we have to enact a plan worthy of it that's #leadership
@vandnabhatia1 and we'll work to fast track private sponsorship with no cap to bring as many #refugees as possible to canada
@vandnabhatia1 we'll work with turkey to remove resettlement obstacles to stop discrimination policies and treat #refugees equally
@vandnabhatia1 and we'll increase presence of cdn diplomatic and immigration officials in region to accelerate processing of #refugees
@vandnabhatia1 for starters we'll get 10 000 gov't sponsored #refugees out of harms way and on way to canada by end of this year
example of #cpc concern for #refugees an #ndp gov't will live up to canada's reputation as world leader
we're struggling with our own popularity @devinesean tells reporters at city hall #orangewavenepean #nepean #ndp
not a word from #nepean #cpc @andywang_ca and lib @chandranepean on #syrianrefugees not a single word politics is more than door knocking
what @rosiebarton did last night concerning #syrianrefugees is exactly what #journalists should do hold power to account #orangewavenepean
@rosiebarton and the next one is on me
the two young #syrianrefugees boys 5 and 3 who died with their mother on a beach were trying to come to canada we must do better
the #orangewavenepean is building momentum order your lawn sign today let's build a better #nepean together
#syrianrefugees are not an #election issue but a #humanitarian issue so this election let's elect better humanitarians
one test of our nation's character is how we take of the most unfortunate the world needs canada and canada must do more #syrianrefugees
humanity washed ashore as a 3 yr old syrian refugee face down in the sand canada must do more #global #crisis
don't know who i want to hug more @pauldewar or @rosiebarton challenge the gov't on #syrian #refugee crisis
@rosiebarton you're the best so grateful for how hard you fought on that issue this issue has been knawing at me for weeks thanks
@d_veress hmm email me at sean devine@ndp ca with name and address will get it there asap
humanity washed ashore today in the form of a 3 yr old syrian refugee who died face down in the sand on turkey's shore canada must do more
#nepean voters make sure you know the new riding boundaries and confirm that you're registered to vote

chris alexander has a lot to answer for but that's not where we are right now we're worried about how we got
george and our area candidates met with mayor watson this morning to discuss the ndp's plan for a better ottawa
@billyholiday613 absolutely email your request and address to george brown@ndp ca and we'll install one for you
some sound words of advice
@marlenerivier @ndptsunami go marlene
this is absolutely unacceptable and will not continue under a ndp government
perhaps this is the reason david mcguinty does not mention justin on his campaign signs
you don't need to wait until oct 19 to send stephen harper his pink slip here's how
an ndp government will support greater participation of low income and disadvantaged youth in physical activity

@canadianmv is a great org check it out #samarachat
this is great #samarachat
i would extend to grade school @youthvote_ca is great initiative my kids are very excited to vote #samarachat
truth best complement i get is that i'm normal
@rob_oliphant @samaracda nice but can you bat
@samaracda @rob_oliphant also i have a pop up office every wk in coffee shop in dif't part of riding anyone can come by met @wickdchiq
here's thoughts from lauren one of my awesome team members #samarachat
@samaracda @rob_oliphant chatting after doing #yogaonthehill handing out popsicles helped start the convo sadly thunderstorm today
any youth on my team out there on #samarachat what motivates you to volunteer @votecatherine
many youth on my campaign i think would say that talking to people at the doors is real matters #samarachat
many of comments in #samarachat fit well with @banffforum's 2015 theme young the restless tackling the coming generational divide
this is a really interesting point #samarachat
aside @alisonloat rocks #samarachat
absolutely agree relationships not talking points listen engage empower #samarachat
this#samarachat
yes or 16yr old who will be voting soon no age limit on volunteering get many volunteers this way #samarachat
and relate issues that youth may not be thinking about e g pensions in compelling terms about how they matter to youth #samarachat
i think we need to do both talk seriously about immediate issues youth are talking about #samarachat
#samarachat
another good point #samarachat
#samarachat
good point #samarachat
this is perception many have about politicians not just youth must do better #samarachat
@keyvan05 that's a problem but i do think most politicians actually want to engage but not sure how
@jhilderman you've always been cool jane
@davidgourlay but we also need to talk about issues that young people are focused on jobs student debt env't cda in world #samarachat
thanks cc @culiberals #samarachat
agree remember going to political event in uni thought it was a club for cool kids didn't come back #samarachat
interesting maybe i'm wrong maybe it's just the way we frame the issues young people do become older people
sure but when i was a youth i wasn't excited or focused on pensions aging healthcare
absolutely engage where youth are no separation between online offline worlds for many people
absolutely i believe politicians have an obligation to reach out listen and respond to young people's concerns
absolutely i find convos between my me my younger canvassers with young people at the door make a difference
young people we won't vote because you don't care about your issues #samarachat 3 3
politicians why don't you vote because then we will care about your issues #samarachat 2 3
was at panel of engaged young people we had a chicken egg discussion young people why don't you care about our issues #samarachat 1 3
i also see young people who say that they are int'd in politics but don't feel that they know enough #samarachat
that's awesome
important stat from @samaracda's report elections turnout for youth contacted by political leaders was 15 higher #samarachat
very interesting report all #elxn42 candidates should read
i don't have all the answers but i've worked hard to listen to young people many joined my team after #samarachat
the #lpc is committed to implementing all of the #trc recommendations with #mmiw inquiry a top priority #elxn42
#lpc gov will restore fed leadership on #affordablehousing w a comprehensive nat'l housing strategy #elxn42 #ottcity
great meeting up w @culiberals last night excited to have so many new students joining our team #generationtrudeau
canada needs ambition on refugees in making a fairer society in rebuilding our cities creating a green economy #betterispossible #lpc

i wish to thank all the great volunteers working on my campaign in ottawa south you truly inspire me please

plaisir de discuter avec michel c auger sur les sujet du jours @radiocanadainfo
listen in now to midi info @radiocanadainfo to hear our discussion on hot issues of the day
no better way to spend the day then engaging kids in political discussion
@fredhahncupe thanks that was fun
best part of canvassing is meeting so many engaged and informed people feeling optimistic about canada's future
veterans stood up for canada they should never have to question whether their prime minister will stand up for them
tom's plan will make ei eligibility fairer and invest in training that helps young canadians find a permanent

@cfraottawa @dev_balkissoon says conservatives let in more immigrants than any party in history immigration declined by 1 3 under harper
@cfraottawa @dev_balkissoon ask an out of work federal scientist if he or she is happy about the way conservatives treat ps
@cfraottawa you either believe in a public service or you do not we are committed to respect for the public service #brownistheneworange
@cfraottawa @dev_balkissoon rejects the premise of that question
@cfraottawa @dev_balkissoon you don't balance budgets by withholding 8 7b in committed spending
@cfraottawa a government can grow its economy while living within its means #brownistheneworange
@cfraottawa lower small business taxes from 11 to 9 will provide more and better jobs for over 8 million canadians
@cfraottawa even with an increase to 17 per cent in the federal rate canada should remain competitive cbc

@joeboughner happy to meet this week cath@cathmckenna ca am interested in your thoughts now much catch my zzzzzsss
@joeboughner it's too late but let's chat over coffee but we haven't baked in job cuts #cpc #ndp have in their budget
@joeboughner #ndp has bought into #cpc austerity budget but pretending they can spend it's not possible cynical politics turns cdns off
@joeboughner i'm not giving you spin we have been honest about needing to stimulate economy by running short term deficits
@joeboughner assumption that any review job cuts is wrong #ndp budget accepted #cpc assumptions including public service job cuts #fact
@joeboughner our platform is focused on investment growth #ndp accepted #cpc budget which included cuts to public service #fact
@joeboughner public servants want respect to provide services to cdns we aren't talking about austerity cuts #cpc #ndp are
@joeboughner the #ndp is the party that bought into #cpc austerity budget including cuts to public servants
#lpc believes in public service as a partner @justintrudeau's letter to public servants
@joeboughner not sure what you're referring to #ndp signed on to #cpc budget that included public service job cuts
@murraygamble thanks murray please vote encourage your friends and if you want #realchange join us volunteer@catherinemckenna ca #lpc
@oh_rick_oh so hire a woman at 50 of population hardly an interest group no shortage arbour clarke robinson etc @jimdella

if harper cares so much about rights of muslim women where is the same compassion for 1 200 mmiw not a campaign strategy i suppose #ndp
and in other news #cpc and harper were handed a 13b surplus and gave us 7 consecutive deficits seven #heavesteve #ready4change #nepean

the #ndp will repeal bill c 51 that's it that's all #orangewavenepean #tm4pm #elxn42
retirement plans and benefits need to be respected and not stripped away oas cpp are investments for our future #orangewavenepean
the ethical line that was crossed in this election campaign has been the entrenched hate of muslims in harper campaign #orangewavenepean
#ndp has a plan to support veterans and restore programs and services to ensure they live with dignity when they return #orangewavenepean
the #ndp has promised an inquiry into missing and murdered aboriginal women within 100 days of forming gov't #orangewavenepean

dev balkissoon has a scary dream
great meeting neighbours at the riverview community festival
stephen harper has shown himself more than ready to use racism and bigotry as a wedge to divide the public in
frankly anyone who doesn't fully condemn conservative race baiting is himself immoral

lynton crosby at work i detect a slight whiff of sulfur

@bananabrianna80 @rightsprung @jenkins4mp indeed whether niqab or reproduction why do these men think they get to decide for women
the ndp #climatechange plan sets concrete ghg reduction targets and makes big polluters pay to hit those targets
conservative candidates in orleans ottawa vanier and nepean oppose women's reproductive rights

@eleanorsibbert take a photo and email it to me please
@eleanorsibbert i wasn't in the printed edition's photo
and it's safe to presume liberals will finish reading #tpp on or around october 20 utterly lacking #principles
@eleanorsibbert i think it's there once you click the link right that's just the way facebook crops photos
advance polling october 9 12 from 12pm 8pm at 8 locations across #nepean great site #orangewavenepean #elxn42
@lovedemriders good luck in trusting that a victorious #lpc will bring about any change not exactly a party of #principles #tpp #c51
i love @chantalhbert canada has so many great journalists and she's one of my faves such clear reasoning and conviction
#pollsdontpredict
@jordan_b_ross then ask mr arya to withdraw
@jordan_b_ross there's no way wang gets 40 his base is deteriorating many of his supporters are voting #ndp he's an empty suit
thanks for that @mikejunek i'm growing stronger day by day #orangewavenepean
harper omits key info hurtful to auto sector on #tpp vote #tm4pm to protect canada's vital industries #principles
@jordan_b_ross votes aren't wasted where's the guarantee that a vote leads automatically to your expressed desire polls can be wrong
indeed
a vote for me gets you the party you want and the kind of candidate you want not the same for #lpc and #cpc candidates matter mps matter
my advice to liberal supporters who say they wish i was their candidate you're voting for the wrong party make me your candidate #ndp
careful how you vote part 2 end of shift 16 conversations 11 voting #ndp 9 lawn signs this is far from over #nepean principle power
careful how you vote #nepean i just knocked on 5 doors and got 4 lawn sign requests polls lie no one trusts #cpc or #lpc #tm4pm go #ndp
#tpp is a significant concern to 75 of canadians harper trudeau are looking the other way vote #ndp in #nepean
g m exclusive on syrian refugee scandal if this doesn't end #harper then we are not #canada elect me to fight this
@johnefrancis because you trust that an #lpc government will bring about true electoral reform even if it doesn't suit them
here's your chance to hear all 4 #nepean candidates make their pitch who do you feel would stand up represent
lines are being drawn for #elxn42 at fallowfield bus loop in #nepean lots of folks saying they're voting #ndp it's an #orangewavenepean
thanks george
@justintrudeau is a ship without a compass i worry that #canada doesn't know the product that it's purchasing

canadians pay the second highest prices for prescription drugs in the world and harpers deal will keep it that
images from last night's all candidates meeting our conservative opponent was too busy to answer your questions

that about sums things up
words of wisdom from nathan
this is what i have come to believe and have spent my professional career promoting
david mcguinty voted for bill c 51 good mp #repealc51
tpp was negotiated by corporations for corporations any benefit it provides to canadians will be purely incidental
healthcare pharmacare childcare mulcair
three days until advance polls open i know who i'm voting for
tpp isn't about free trade it's about managing our trade relationships on behalf of powerful lobbies
