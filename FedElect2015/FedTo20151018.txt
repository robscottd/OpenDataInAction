@cathmckenna @poli_nerd omg i agree w u 1000 i am all for saving a few trees

@cathmckenna hi catherine if you believe workers in federally regulated industries deserve a 15 hr minimum wage i'd stand corrected thx
@cathmckenna @alyf_o @kiavashnajafi @gmbutts kinda ironic considering the equal voice dp
about same as @ontliberal @kathleen_wynne @sousacharles annual debt rt @cathmckenna 14 billion #onpoli #cdnpoli
@cathmckenna @karenleibovici appalling
@cathmckenna @jec79 at least they have a balanced budget am i right
@cathmckenna so glad you like it we had ones for @justintrudeau and @gmbutts too if you need any more just let me know #realchange
@cathmckenna @ep_squared @justintrudeau charisma is a great quality
@cathmckenna @gmbutts @justintrudeau is pathetic #lpc is just using him for his pedigree his looks and everybody know it #cdnpoli #elxn42
@cathmckenna @gmbutts @justintrudeau lol wow i was at trudeau's rally today awesome energy great people
@cathmckenna great idea in fact we should all be celebrating the #scc debate or no debate
@cathmckenna @alyf_o @kiavashnajafi @gmbutts its all about deflection from their misleading federal minimum wage #cdnpoli #lpc
@cathmckenna @gmbutts @justintrudeau a lot of grey hair in that group get off my lawn
@cathmckenna thanks for following we hope u can join us @ #childhoodcancerawarenessevent sept 13 on parliament hill
@cathmckenna i guess that's a no thanks
@cathmckenna keep canvassing and meeting with the community
@cathmckenna wow this is brilliant
so @cathmckenna sounds like youre saying that if elected you wouldnt work with a conservative or ndp government #cdnpoli
@cathmckenna more puzzling still was justin's inability to answer a simple question well actually that's kind of expected
@cathmckenna @will__murray what a nonsense button why hide behind scc just answer the question some canadians don't know the answer
@cathmckenna it's like he missed the day in law school when you're told to read judgements to find the answers
@cathmckenna @jayroc5000 either he lied to globe mail or to parliament either way he is a goddamned liar #goodtogo
@cathmckenna @farrowdreessen i'd love to see a local debate on the issues where cities need fed help child care housing transit poverty

@cathmckenna are the liberals committing to new funding for renewal of old stock and new builds other than for key groups i don't see it

@cathmckenna @poli_nerd @justintrudeau no sniffer dogs full body search background checks or gag orders required to sttend

@cathmckenna joins in our celebration of 5 years as #ottawasbestburger today #supportlocal and help @parkdalefood

@cathmckenna @ottriverkeeper what a farce qc does nothing and no one talks about it maybe when you get elected you will again say nothin
@cathmckenna you may want to act federally on why quebec has done nothing in 8 years 29 outflows nothing done please dont say 2 sides
@cathmckenna @ottriverkeeper meridith any news on the quebec side of the equation 29 outflows still pouring raw sewage in while we spend
@cathmckenna @ottriverkeeper i wish quebec would keep thei r2007 promise to shu t29 outflows while we spend 1 4 of a billion on our side
@cathmckenna check out this app gametime use code st10 for 10 when you download here
@cathmckenna that is a long swim way to go
@cathmckenna @uranowski indeed and it should have been an election issue in 2011 the montreal gazette editorial board sure made it one
@cathmckenna @susandelacourt true fiscal conservatives should be hoping for electoral reform disassembled the faux conservative machine
@cathmckenna i studied quebec politics last year and we discussed this at length
@cathmckenna @emmmacfarlane the scc specifically didn't define what they meant by clear referring to the question or the majority
@cathmckenna it's not against the scc ruling the scc specifically said it was a political issue
@cathmckenna i know it's liberal red but very fitting to reveal on red friday to support our troops in canada we wear red every friday
@cathmckenna love the red colour
@cathmckenna love it
@cathmckenna @dmitchellppf what canadians have clearly seen in macleans debate
@cathmckenna from #ottawa showing how parties can work together for the betterment of canadians #cdnpoli #gpc #lpc
@cathmckenna @pmharper @thomasmulcair @elizabethmay the other party leaders are obviously threatened by may's great oratory skills
@cathmckenna it's a privilege to be on your team and have you as a role model
@cathmckenna @quincykk too bad your leader did not perform as well as many canadians expected but worst he doesn't mention team behind him
@cathmckenna @quincykk we had some too the room erupted in cheers at best country in the world my neighbours now think i'm a jingoist
@cathmckenna @younggreenscan shame on trudeau for shouting over elizabeth may and not letting her speak
@cathmckenna would love to have you on board #realchange #teamtrudeau
@cathmckenna canada had a reputation of being peacekeepers leaders will @justintrudeau return that stature
@cathmckenna @pmharper @thomasmulcair @elizabethmay she's the best of the lot of them brought it tonight
@cathmckenna @pmharper @thomasmulcair @elizabethmay #addwomenimprovepolitics
@cathmckenna @liberal_party @justintrudeau new campaign slogan #swipeleftforharper
@cathmckenna @liberal_party justin trudeau is killing mewith how bad this whole thing isfor realz
@cathmckenna @cpercysearle @justintrudeau killing his chances of winning
@cathmckenna @justintrudeau mulcair is trying to rely on catchy phrases #notgoingtowork #macdebate
@cathmckenna so raising the min wage not a progressive policy goal for the lpc gotcha
@cathmckenna what's the lpc alternative no federal minimum wage no leadership in raising min wage whatsoever
@cathmckenna dialling in to wish @justintrudeau a fantastic debate we're behind u 43 000 doors counting #elexn42
@cathmckenna heh love to but @jeanetterule and i are having a geeky debate date night at home
@cathmckenna and he treats anyone who disagrees with him as an enemy not just an opponent
@cathmckenna @antoniaz @cbcpolitics and he's a bully
@cathmckenna @antoniaz @cbcpolitics and he's a bully
@cathmckenna @justintrudeau yeah growing the economy with tax cuts is real change nothing like what harper tried #elxn42 and failed
@cathmckenna @ottawasuncom how appropriate and hoping that october 20 is a great first day for you
huh never believed in horoscopes b4 but rt @cathmckenna quite love my @ottawasuncom horoscope from yesterday
@cathmckenna @ottawasuncom happy belated birthday
@cathmckenna wynne progressive is that a joke 70 don't want hydro sold yet she is going ahead seems like a harper thing to do
@cathmckenna what fine print it's pretty clear where do you get many cdns a video of three people sources you're misleading
@cathmckenna so what is the liberal party's position on the federal minimum wage
@cathmckenna @gmbutts @cbcpolitics and by crock i mean that it's not about gender it's about policy
@cathmckenna @gmbutts @cbcpolitics what a crock
@cathmckenna @gmbutts is this a lib endorsement of pedophiles child pornographers like ben levin hired by wynne for sex ed grooming
@cathmckenna @gmbutts lib perception wynne is a corrupted incompetent sick bitch who hired a fucking pedophile wtf is wrong with you
@cathmckenna @cbcpolitics i'm not a harper fan but don't you think he'd be acting the same towards them even if they were men maybe
@cathmckenna i knew what this meant when it first came out because i actually read it wishing people actually read what everyone says
@cathmckenna
@cathmckenna wishing the media actually dealt with the lies that harper doles out daily but rather pick on this detail
@cathmckenna every time i bike slowly over that bridge on a sidewalk bc i'm not suicidal i can't help but to think of @brunetcarl
@cathmckenna but it is not a recession because the last time we had a recession the dollar and a barrel of oil were both stronger #cpcfail
@cathmckenna happy birthday
@cathmckenna beautiful the clouds turned a beautiful dark red near the end tonight
@cathmckenna #trudeauforrealchange
@cathmckenna #trudeauforrealchange

@pierrepoilievre pls join us sept13 for #childhoodcancerawarenessevent on parliament hill rt #gogoldcanada
@pierrepoilievre you look like every foreign tourist arrested in thailand
@pierrepoilievre your profile picture makes you look like a disgraced accountant
@pierrepoilievre you look like a blind person's drawing of stephen colbert after being described his likeness over the phone
@pierrepoilievre look at the mess you've made with your fair elections act #cdnpoli
@pierrepoilievre so he's in good company with your team then the 'balance' this year is at best a smoke screen at worst non existent
@pierrepoilievre remember don't come by my house
@pierrepoilievre oh peter you are such a card
@pierrepoilievre what did the prime minster do first day figure out how to rig the next election #elxn42
@pierrepoilievre @cpc_hq just for fun pierre when you are prime minister what will you do on your first day on the job
@pierrepoilievre @cpc_hq good jab pierre but there was an answer you are the master of the negative ad
@pierrepoilievre @cpc_hq hold on i thought it was prime minster
@pierrepoilievre not a trudeau fan but i bet on his first day he wouldn't be looking for ways to restrict the franchise #cdnpoli #elxn42
@pierrepoilievre @cpc_hq spend the day reaching out to premiers and municipal leaders was the response something @pmharper never did
@pierrepoilievre justin ready to lead harper not fit to lead
@pierrepoilievre and you balanced it by selling assets and plundering a contingency fund even then you won't show a surplus
@pierrepoilievre but didn't he say that if you grow the economy the budget would balance itself why the weaselly half truth #elxn42
@pierrepoilievre pp will you stop making up stuff try to win with some truth for once
@pierrepoilievre can't balance the budget but nice hair
@pierrepoilievre 150 billion in new debt enough said
@pierrepoilievre look who's talking your government never balanced a budget in 8 years always a deficit #cdnpoli
@pierrepoilievre because you put us in a recession and i'm not denying that
liar @pierrepoilievre isn't ruling out a deficit is not equal tocan't balance it at all pp u stevie can't balance it at all
@pierrepoilievre #fedlib's know how to hve budgets bal themselves you your govt haven't a clue liberal's ran surpluses cpc hve not ever
@pierrepoilievre stop cutting and pasting just what you want to hear why don't you include what was said before
@pierrepoilievre that's bc he may decide not to rob ei not to sell off stocks at a loss not rob the contingency fund nice balance
@pierrepoilievre your gov't has created a climate of prolonged debt 0 balanced budgets #harpersrecord bankrupting cda fact #endcpcgovt2015
@pierrepoilievre where have i heard it before oh yeah from @pmharper
@pierrepoilievre or only give them to families who truly need it not millionaires
@pierrepoilievre if these are taxable benefits maybe you should be holding back the tax like employers have to #transparency
@pierrepoilievre are you sending them cpc polo shirts to wear to the bank while cashing the bribe er cheque
@pierrepoilievre you are the champ at twisting facts i'll give you that licking harper's shoes has paid off short on pants and truth
@pierrepoilievre @pmharper almost funny
@pierrepoilievre @bryanmichaud @pmharper also programs and services #slowclap
@pierrepoilievre @pmharper the opposition sees that as lost revenue that needs immediate recovery
@pierrepoilievre @pmharper let me be clear this is bs too#macdebate #elxn2015
@pierrepoilievre more important question is why do so many canadians make less than 30k per year
@pierrepoilievre @pmharper and you've offered more vote bribes than ever before yay now go back to sucking up #elxn42
@pierrepoilievre skippy's on board trying to distract from @pmharper getting his ass kicked in the debate
@pierrepoilievre @pmharper no one supports electoral reform and proportional representation lt 60 secs on google
@pierrepoilievre funny that a guy whose party has run multiple consecutive deficits shares things like this on fb
@pierrepoilievre the liberals are out canvassing in my #stittsville 'hood hopefully we'll see you soon we'll need a sign #elxn42
just some more bradbutting and bsing skippy @pierrepoilievre an election is not a question period where your bs ruled #cdnpoli #elxn42
@pierrepoilievre what do you have against hard working canadians getting a pension that can make their last years more livable #elxn42
@pierrepoilievre @kalicat2 no i can see why you are already doing that worst caretakers of the economy on record bad bad bad 150 b debt
@pierrepoilievre #yourkidsyourway #uccb could be a potential 43 160 bonanza for bc polygamist with 133 kids
@pierrepoilievre 1b is chump change compared with 30b wasted on green energy which jt supports
@pierrepoilievre
@pierrepoilievre @suncoastplace and every liberal sign on a lawn tells you that household supports both these tax grabbers
@pierrepoilievre keep up with the negative sir has costed you 5 votes so far 70 some days to go #cdnpoli
@pierrepoilievre @paulcalandra school year gonna start on time seems like @kathleen_wynne more focused on fed politics than her job again
@pierrepoilievre well given that your government in part helped with that it's responsible to see you admit take some blame
@pierrepoilievre for once you may want to ask trudeau the teacher about this one
@pierrepoilievre i would think the requirements lists handed out by schools would be better suited but who was i anyway a teacher
@pierrepoilievre @ctvnews they actually want you to keep them and invest them into a day care plan crap plan eh
@pierrepoilievre thank you for all these facts about wynne never would've known all the good things she does without ur bi partisan help
@pierrepoilievre you still believe that after a decade have you even had beer and popcorn or are you still not of age
@pierrepoilievre his plan raises ultra wealthy tax rate by 2 since u slashed it that much over the years he's just putting it back 2 norm
@pierrepoilievre higher tax scheme you mean raising it back to normal
@pierrepoilievre those in glass houses should not throw stones #election2015 #harpereconomy
@pierrepoilievre @pmharper did you just take your job creation graph and just change the title
@pierrepoilievre it's dishonest to spend taxpayer for #election2015 householder that arrived 2day #cdnpoli
@pierrepoilievre a tax policy libs got from the ndp
@pierrepoilievre imagine that coupled with the ndp business tax carbon tax and higher min wage ontario jobs on life support say no to taxs
@pierrepoilievre polygamist blackmore can't wait to thank you for uccb money harper supporting polygamists nationwide
@pierrepoilievre @jenkins4mp @eycanada yes now but come tax time it will get clawed back as taxable income or benefit as you spin it
@pierrepoilievre practice fiscal environmental responsibility stop the mail outs #timeforchange
@pierrepoilievre and the increase in #elxn42 length will cost us how much higher than the 30
@pierrepoilievre yes let's place our trust in a prime minister who steadfastly stood by this guy #cdnpoli #elxn42
@pierrepoilievre
@pierrepoilievre would you trust a government that is fear mongering to win votes care only about itself undemocratic puts jobs second
#wakeupcanada#ontario is heading to #bankruptcy under wynne's #corruptliberalgov rt@pierrepoilievre scary
@pierrepoilievre teen marijuana use not linked to later depression lung cancer other health problems study finds

@pierrepoilievre the cdn taxpayer is taxed to pay mp's gold plated pensions for lifeglad to pay yours when you are evicted in #elxn42
@pierrepoilievre appointed minister of poutine #cdnpoli
@pierrepoilievre is that why harper increased the employment insurance premiums and increased import tariffs dramatically
@pierrepoilievre really means 'hurry up with this beccause i need the money now' so transparent so desperate
@pierrepoilievre i'm curious if this is still the way you feel #elxn42
@pierrepoilievre @jeffjedras unless he's a bad man then good riddance #pmo will let me know which right
@pierrepoilievre @ottguy when skippy calls someone honorable i get this taste of vomit in my mouth #cdnpoli #elexn42 #cpcrap
@pierrepoilievre @michi_phillips if you can't afford to save for your own rrsp how the hell can you afford to have wynne take more for tax
@pierrepoilievre what would've been youropinion it the cpc had tought of it
@pierrepoilievre um where is the missing 3 1 billion your govt has lost selective memory eh #cdnpoli #elxn42
@pierrepoilievre please enlighten us how a pension is a tax this from someone who gets a golden pension from the taxpayers #cdnpoli
@pierrepoilievre so the conservative plan is to bury us in debt good plan skippy
@pierrepoilievre i see what she's trying to do but she is going about it the wrong way
@pierrepoilievre anyone in their 50s now will not benefit from this pension people need to keep money in their pockets now its just a tax
@pierrepoilievre not sure why you're attacking our premier during a federal election you do know she's provincial right
@pierrepoilievre i know aht your pension costs and i know what this would have cost if the feds allowed the cra to administer as requested
@pierrepoilievre cpc hasn't got a clue about budget and will keep on digging canada's economic recession #cdnpoli
@pierrepoilievre so how many actual ppl are donating to your elxn campaign this time why do taxpayers have to pay your 90k tab #cdnpoli
@pierrepoilievre from the fool with the gold plated pension paid for by taxpayers

@pierrepoilievre we are canada not ontario shut up and stop the damn lying all the time you need help
@pierrepoilievre you are a liar
@pierrepoilievre this is not how a real man conducts himself
@pierrepoilievre saying something looks interesting is not good enough post your proof or is this just more lying from you shame on you
@pierrepoilievre post the article or statement where he is saying he is going to do anything like this
@pierrepoilievre translation @pmharper committed to eliminating canada's oil industry by 2100 but we hope you won't notice
@pierrepoilievre @maddiedimuccio no biggie almost a quarter of them are planning on leaving the province 'cause of hydro costs anyway
@pierrepoilievre @pmharper better leave the room stevie cuz you been using public office for your own benefit for 10 yrs via your cronies
@pierrepoilievre thankfully we won't have to deal with your sorry ass much longer because you're gonna get it handed to you in oct

@pierrepoilievre pierre what's gonna happen with the uccb or tfsa's in 80 years you bloody fool
@pierrepoilievre where's all the hot air coming out of your ass i mean your mouth now pierre
@pierrepoilievre @jenkins4mp cant ever recall a federal party meddling in prov politics while campaigning the way you bullies have
@pierrepoilievre you're such a petty jerk no one believes your #cpc lies #elxn42 #cdnpoli
@pierrepoilievre @sheilagunnreid and think tanks say it isn't necessary there isn't a retirement crisis
@pierrepoilievre justin also supports wynne and her sex ed curriculum despite involvement of a pedophile in its making
@pierrepoilievre or to a govt that gave 400 million to a company marz as a bailout w out public disclosure justin would he backs wynne
@pierrepoilievre dude you can't even manage your job in #cdnpoli this is no time to add #onpoli to your duties #elxn42
@pierrepoilievre @judyrb48 @kathleen_wynne 1k these liberals just can't stop helping themselves to my salary i've had enough #onpoli
@pierrepoilievre you really want to talk lackeys you don't even breathe without harper's say so
@pierrepoilievre idiot
@pierrepoilievre you said we were getting cheaper elections i believe
@pierrepoilievre @manny_ottawa it's not just the cost its the additional administrative burden
@pierrepoilievre @seanroofus yes because #hudak promised it too
@pierrepoilievre you are a vomitous mass skippy
@pierrepoilievre @robertlibman harper proven leadership more like proven crook hidden undercover operations #harperinchains
@pierrepoilievre guess what #hudak would have had to pay for canceling them too it was part of his platform
@pierrepoilievre moronic strategy referring to justin tomorrow we'll be talking about nigel through end of campaign #elxn42
@pierrepoilievre so the cpp is a tax too i guess
@pierrepoilievre @wgibson58 god save us from these wasteful arrogant #liberals
@pierrepoilievre skippy all party leaders had scrapping the gas plants in their platform libs won so got stuck w actually paying for it gt

@_andrewleslie my military friends are very angry couple are afghan vets so many hurt so many lied to so many fearing for jobs
@_andrewleslie did you not propose to cut reservist jobs
@_andrewleslie is running his campaign with military efficiency blocking any twitter users who aren't willing to take his orders #cdnpoli
@_andrewleslie @pmharper isn't this going to aggravate the personnel equipment imbalance

@cathmckenna @jonathanmcleod i think it's pretty cool
@cathmckenna @lisachambers201 that explains why he supports the conservative child benefit program and not a more progressive one
@cathmckenna @pdmcleod sigh it's a great design
@cathmckenna @pdmcleod hi i would have made the spokes thinner gl
@cathmckenna great thanks for your speedy response appreciate it
@cathmckenna @thevinetwayway agreed i wish @cafreeland shared that sentiment too
@cathmckenna a great idea but some recommended reading on the branding
@cathmckenna wow nice logo are you channelling obama hillary or chairman mao
@cathmckenna from what i've been told you've been doing exactly that for 2 years now a win would make u a dragon killer good luck
@cathmckenna buttons will also come in handy of you run for empress of japan
@cathmckenna @jec79 yes @libdems won 46 seats
be like saying you admire china's govt oh wait #bothoutofcontext #sticktoissues rt @cathmckenna cannot believe mulcair admired thatcher
@cathmckenna @jec79 not true lots of them were voting liberal blaire good up where thatcher left off
@cathmckenna looking at those comments about bulk water export again interesting
@cathmckenna can't wait to see these signs when i'm back in sept
@cathmckenna what planet do you inhabit think of all the great grit spinmeisters of yore remember adscam
@cathmckenna hey msm unions donating to ndp questions to mulcair about praising thatcher soon
@cathmckenna and words of prominent conservatives it's unfathomable that mr novak knew pmsh didn't #elxn42
@cathmckenna i would of been surprised before we learned he almost took a job with the conservative party
@cathmckenna he is also a bit of a chameleon dishonest sneaky
@cathmckenna jt got it right mulcair is an old style politician #miragemulcair
@cathmckenna @ottawabike oh god nooooo

@cathmckenna mulcair will say anything to anyone for power blue orange brown bs
@cathmckenna hey mulcair @votealabuzreba resigned for past comments will you resign for praising thatcher
@cathmckenna trudeau got slammed for past remarks so mulcair praising thatcher is ok
@cathmckenna moving to the centre under preston then blair was their ticket back to power thatcher and then major won elections
@cathmckenna point of info the labour party elected to go further left in response to thatcher that's what killed them in 80s 90s
@cathmckenna ha maybe regardless you've got a vote from me even if i missed the canvas
@cathmckenna someone knocked on my door but i missed it
@cathmckenna the prime minister should be called to testify under oath yep course you'd hafta catch 'im first

@cathmckenna @bruceanderson i agree but his army of lawyers will prevent that at least until long after the election #cdnpoli
@cathmckenna @smell3roses he will just lie his face off get serious
@cathmckenna media party should be called to testify why they are all asking the same question is there collusion between progressives
@cathmckenna @gmbutts @picardonhealth and how exactly did @justintrudeau campaigning w mcguinty on #bill115 help #elxn42 #cdnpoli
@cathmckenna @gmbutts @picardonhealth in ontario liberals cut services doctors nurses so to fund transgender surgery experimentation

@pauldewar hi paul long time curiously does your riding encompass westboro i have just over my office there
@pauldewar a pmo that interferes with our right to vote in our canada is a good enough reason to end the harper regime for canada #securecan
@pauldewar @chuddles11 paul if the pmo interferes directly with a can citizen's vote isn't that possibly criminal behaviour rcmp said so
@pauldewar 2 gentlemen's duffy wright are solely responsible they are being held accountable but wright just a witness not
@pauldewar i give you credit for going out having conversations with people answering questions more than can be said for @pmharper
@pauldewar @bbcworld and the helpless syrians certainly believe you
@pauldewar maybe you should pick up the phone and call those who created the mess with freedom and democracy on middle east make sense
yet the ndp didn't propose any plan to help will we hear about your proposed future plans soon @pauldewar
@pauldewar i like to solar clothes dryer
@pauldewar resignations due to party requests based on people's human rights activism
@pauldewar i believe that we desperately need a change of gov't thus my vote but it's depressing to see the current trend of
@pauldewar at a party level that does not include human rights for all including for palestinians
@pauldewar i'm feeling very disappointed in this party that i have supported for so long how can there be discussions of human rights
@pauldewar from running in the election bc of the positions on palestine criticism of israel's treatment of palestine they have taken
@pauldewar i will vote for you in this election but i have real trouble w the ndp for asking individuals to remove themselves

@andywang_ca wow love how you can fit talking points into your reply q how is knocking on doors fighting for anything other than votes
@andywang_ca #tnc tax cuts dead money people don't create jobs @devinesean
@andywang_ca why the false cpc spin about what the opposition may or may not do to the economy harper was wrong about recession #cdnpoli
@andywang_ca and if your party didn't place all the economic bets on the oil industry maybe we wouldn't be in a recession wake up indeed
@andywang_ca any justification for you skipping on meeting w mayor of ottawa
@andywang_ca do you condone your colleague's actions anything being done about this @parmgill @pmharper
@andywang_ca @pmharper if you love canada vote anyone but conservative
@andywang_ca @pmharper you didn't even bother to meet with the mayor of the city your riding is in a disgrace
@andywang_ca @pmharper i'm not so much enjoying #closetman's 2nd unforeseen only by #cpc recession so far or the record debt #cdnpoli
@andywang_ca @pmharper will skippy be there to hold your hand andy #cdnpoli

@andywang_ca mayor said all 9 #cpc candidates either failed to respond to invite or cancelled last minute which did you do for #democracy
@andywang_ca great work meeting and talking with residents is by far the most important and valuable use of your time
@andywang_ca but yet no time to respond or meet with @jimwatsonottawa such disrespect for our mayor is unconscionable

@cathmckenna @2015inthehouse @nstdenis @justintrudeau not for mulcair #afraidtodebate
@cathmckenna @nstdenis @justintrudeau ndp actions on women's issues and parity speak for themselves 2 2
@cathmckenna @nstdenis @justintrudeau why pray tell would the lder of the off oppo participate in a debate without the pm there 1 2
@cathmckenna @2015inthehouse shame onmulcair twistingliberals expenditure concerns to not caring about women violence
@cathmckenna @2015inthehouse @nstdenis @justintrudeau #afraidtodebate #mulcairmenteur
@cathmckenna @nstdenis @justintrudeau meanwhile' back at the ranch
@cathmckenna trying to source the original from @justintrudeau feed but can't find it is that for reals
@cathmckenna getting ready for #tommy2030
@cathmckenna about your campaign @votecatherine misquoting a @ottawacitizen article about your chances in oc 2
@cathmckenna you criticize the tories about accountability but you have yet to respond to my question 1
@cathmckenna catherine tks for your message you are a very busy person these days
@cathmckenna @kiavashnajafi @the_wonny @valckendp i had recently seen something indicating mulcair abstained but should have checked thx
@cathmckenna @kiavashnajafi @the_wonny @valckendp i stand corrected i must have seen an earlier reading or the proposal may put forth 1 2
@cathmckenna i'm still hoping you can comment on your campaign's twitter account misquoting an article about the oc race
@cathmckenna us britain need to stop propping up assad regime using isis as a flimsy excuse west cut the hypocricy stop supporting murder
@cathmckenna under harper our rights in what is supposed to be a democracy are being eroded faster than the icecaps #elxn42 #fed2015
@cathmckenna @englundbob and we are grateful to hear it speak your mind
@cathmckenna what is your personal stand on bill c51
@cathmckenna glad you're clear but it's not for me wd trudeau remove powers of disruption from csis
@cathmckenna today is itnl #overdose day please rt and let your community know that od doesn't discriminate #od15
@cathmckenna @johangreg cpc cands have only one voice the voice of someone who is out of touch with the canadian context go libs
@cathmckenna @bfaparsons @anthonyfurey @thomasmulcair funny the ndp is still dumping on lpc for balancing the budget while in govt too
@cathmckenna1 you are ridiculous 2 adam vaughan also has a toronto sun column @bfaparsons #elxn42
2 billion vancouver seems to manage without railings why not #ottawa @cathmckenna @giacomopanico @ottawamorning
@cathmckenna thanks for the rt interestingly i'm doing some work with brittany twiss right now i hope your campaign is going well
@cathmckenna @muskokamoneybag @kiavashnajafi @the_wonny @valckendp meanwhile the ndp are welcoming those types
@cathmckenna @muskokamoneybag @kiavashnajafi @the_wonny @valckendp mulcair is exactly the kind of neocon that the liberals are moving from
@cathmckenna @muskokamoneybag @kiavashnajafi @the_wonny @valckendp mulcair epitomizes all that you seemingly dislike about the liberal past
@cathmckenna see you sept 17th thank you for agreeing to participate in our #ottawacentre all candidates forum
@cathmckenna just like you got out of nafta killed the gst brought in nat'l daycare right we can totally trust #lpc you swear #elxn42
@cathmckenna liberals behind two most egregious assaults on civil liberties in history #warmeasuresact #g20 #c51 whither voices #elxn42
@cathmckenna rhetorical question i know but my guess for some its a secure job and great pension maybe even a plus you can hide
@cathmckenna @muskokamoneybag like the economy jobs an inquiry isn't high on radar imagine if they were part cpc base there be an inquiry
@cathmckenna @gmbutts 1 you're entitled to your opinion 2 adam vaughan has a sun column what's the point of that comment
@cathmckenna tm's saying in 4 yrs not speaking clearly as to what happens for 3 years prior yet clear when saying it'll take jt 11 yrs
@cathmckenna i'd like to display a sign of yours but i'm in a carleton university residence does this create any issues with delivery
@cathmckenna @thomasmulcair @gillesbz and fuck 'em 'cause you'll be long gone by the time the bill comes due #amirite#bonus
@cathmckenna @sunnydays180 @_andrewleslie @justintrudeau heartfelt thoughts re leslie bilking vets for 40k moving expenses for a few blocks
@cathmckenna @poli_nerd yes and you're tackling many very important issues
@cathmckenna shouldn't be too hard either as they'd be previously tabled #c51 amendments that got voted down by conservatives and the ndp
@cathmckenna @kiavashnajafi @the_wonny @valckendp and ndp will continue to grandstand since they have nothing else to offer
@cathmckenna no you raise corporate taxes and eliminate oil subsidies to pay for it why does the lpc want coddle bay st and big oil
@cathmckenna but that's not correct info sharing and expanded no fly measures are some of the worst parts and your party supports them
@cathmckenna i'm sorry that wasn't my intention i was just pointing out your party's record on c51
@cathmckenna possibly a lethal mistake to support it in the first place
@cathmckenna yeah nothing not unless you actually google their policy on such issues you'll be a terrible mp with that type of attitude
@cathmckenna ndp have never been responsible for the security of 35 million canadians they talk tough without even knowing security files
@cathmckenna @gmbutts @anthonyfurey barely a month ago trudeau publicly stated commitment to balancing budget what's changed #miredin3rd
@cathmckenna @seamusoregan @anthonyfurey @thomasmulcair why is ndp lying to the most needy canadians #elxn2015
@cathmckenna by ignoring expert opinion w out a reasonable successful alternative is @pmharper personally liable 4 damages cdnpoli
really i want proportional representation so i have the freedom to vote ndp for it how is that imposing fear mongering @cathmckenna
incase you've forgotten @cathmckenna @thomasmulcair made announcement 2 months before @justinturdeau's #cdnpoli
so we know @cathmckenna is not pragmatic attacking media @davidakin works for sun media one of the best cdn journalists out there
@cathmckenna @jigglypants44 @_andrewleslie @justintrudeau how about heartfelt pieces by people who were kettled by bill blair
@cathmckenna @gmbutts short term deficits also contribute to climate change think about the grand kids
@cathmckenna
well goal of the sun is to promote right wing ideology part of which includes killing lpc for 2 party us nightmare @cathmckenna @gmbutts
@cathmckenna fyi
@cathmckenna sunshine boy oh i should do standup
@cathmckenna @gmbutts what's puzzling is all the right wing columnists supporting mulcair says a lot he's harper's rw replacement
politicians who pledge balanced budgets no matter what politically negligent #elxn42 @cathmckenna @gmbutts @anthonyfurey @thomasmulcair
yeah your party sure listened to the experts when you all voted for harper's #c51 right @cathmckenna
@cathmckenna they don't trust them to go off script hah plus if recorded on media you can't get someone to take the blame resign
@cathmckenna @kittythefool @ottawacitizen he's probably studying his lines sent from above for his meeting with the mayor #snort
@cathmckenna @forgerat in actual fact dougald is a liberal supporter expressing his personal views
@cathmckenna when the media union registers to campaign against conservatives they lose objectivity integrity impartiality credibility
while conservative candidate refuses interviews @cathmckenna responds to journalists incl en franais #realchange
@cathmckenna @ottawacitizen people who run for public office who can't address the public makes sense right
@cathmckenna @ottawacitizen cpc candidates who fail to talk to press or debate demonstrate the kind of independence they'll have as an mp
@cathmckenna pretty please get someone to ask mulcair where he got 11 years from 2019 2016 3 years

@dev_balkissoon why are you even in the campaign if you run away from answering questions what are you afraid of
@dev_balkissoon do you condone your colleague's actions anything being done about this @parmgill @pmharper
@dev_balkissoon cpc looking after residents' needs is an oxymoron #cdnpoli
@dev_balkissoon what would you say is the biggest need that ottawa south has
@dev_balkissoon done today impressed with you as a candidate
@dev_balkissoon why won't you take media questions hiding something afraid you won't have honest answers
@dev_balkissoon why should anyone vote for you when you're such a coward that you won't take any questions from the media
@dev_balkissoon your party has been in office so long leadership seems to be coasting no new ideas #elxn42 is about renewal
@galipeauorleans should have been meeting with the mayor bad planning lead to unnecessary bad press in #ottawa @cpc_hq @pmharper #cdnpoli
@galipeauorleans do you condone your colleague's actions anything being done about this @parmgill @pmharper

@abdulabdi6 if you truly want to represent shouldn't you be willing to meet with city leaders
@abdulabdi6 and this doesn't answer as to why you felt it wasn't necessary for you to meet with jim watson
@abdulabdi6 follows us for like 10 years post secondary 2 2
@abdulabdi6 does it not concern you that my generation can't afford to own homes or start families due to crippling student debt that 1 2

@cathmckenna @canadiancynic look everyone it's a harper supporter
@cathmckenna set aside chris alexander for a moment stephen harpers hypocrisy over syrian refugees
@cathmckenna red tories who supported clark mulroney left conservative party years ago now many others will too #notmycanada #cdnpoli
@cathmckenna the #harpergovt has deliberately designed it that way to avoid fulfilling canada's un obligations even churches are frustrated
infuriating because of bureaucracy a group applying to sponsor a syrian family would never be successful #elxn42

@mauril_belanger @minchrisa @jimwatsonottawa why does your party not support military action it's disgraceful
@mauril_belanger votre chef affirme faire une campagne propre et positive comment justifiez vous ses commentaires sur pol harper #polcan
@mauril_belanger as you're my mp what do you think the right number of refugees is #refugee200k
@mauril_belanger what will you do to allow more refugees to come to canada if re elected what is the position of the #lpc
@mauril_belanger canada needs to commit to helping syrian refugees this crisis is appalling and unnecessary

@pauldewar @fawcettpsf the more he drones on the more he confirms the real cpc position they're not like us
mt @pauldewar this is unfortunate @minchrisa defends canadas response to refugee crisis #cdnpoli #elxn42 #syria
@pauldewar @dlbrydon well at least it's clear where different parties stand
@pauldewar it's not just unfortunate it's un canadian and borders on hate crime #cdnpoli #syrianrefugees #humanrights #canada

@pauldewar son of one of the best mayors in canada marion dewar should have been ndp leader
@pauldewar @ndp_hq more ndp switch to liberal party double digit approval rise for trudeau
@pauldewar @murrayrankin when the mps power is not in effect how government depattments overstep the mark as there is no control of them
@pauldewar's refugee proposal is the best i've seen so far from a canadian politician deeply researched and doable
@pauldewar the comments' section is incredibly depressing wow
@pauldewar i'm ready to be appointed #syrianrefugees coordinate plz read my #blog #cdnpoli #elxn42 #refugeeswelcome
@pauldewar excellent work today on many levels real leadership in the absence of same from others hopefully will influence undecided votes
@pauldewar @findonnelly sometimes it takes a little lie to get things moving eh
@pauldewar @findonnelly @ndp_hq way to capitalize on the plight of others
@pauldewar @findonnelly @ndp_hq
@pauldewar @findonnelly when did ndp 1st speak on refugee promises on this campaign
@pauldewar yes this is what is needed now put party affiliations aside work together show leadership and save lives @dalydegagne
@pauldewar @findonnelly @ndp_hq #whereisfin get him to apologize cus he got it wrong #elxn42
@pauldewar @ndp_hq paul how many have you personally sponsored how many will u commit to sponsor and take into your home

@pauldewar please answer how can we end this refugee crises if we don't cure the cancer that is causing it words wont do it #ndp #cdnpoli
@pauldewar has a lengthy history of being anti canadian he is that white people are bigots canada hater
@pauldewar notes our 500m for bombing amounts to lt4 of the campaign how many refugees would 500m support
@pauldewar @marcgarneau re @cbcthehouse when are you going to call for 10000s of #african #refugees to be accepted immediately

@pauldewar no canvassers allowed in the bldg and yet every door had a flyer in it my whole floor dumped them
@pauldewar one great way to help the refugee crisis is to elect a new government in canada #cdnpoli #elxn42

@pierrepoilievre @pmharper jobs at the expense of clean air and water what good is that pierre
@pierrepoilievre guess what harper's tax cuts for big corporations add up to more than that #exln42 @bigjmcc
@pierrepoilievre i'm sure @jimbostanford @toby_sanger other labour economists can drive a truck through those 'stats' #elexn42 #canlab

@pierrepoilievre @markalanwhittle @pmharper more jobs is good more jobs paying a living wage would be much better gt
@pierrepoilievre @pmharper higher unemployment and a recession maybe you forgot to mention that save your spin it's wasted on canadians
@pierrepoilievre not to mention the foreign worker program that you screwed up so badly
@pierrepoilievre you say that like you actually have a clue can you say recession i know you can shouldn't you be hiding with joe
@pierrepoilievre @pmharper for who the rich corporations that use tax breaks to benefit ceos and nothing else
@pierrepoilievre @pmharper yup but if you lose a majority you'll know the real reason #billc51 a disgrace to magna carta
@pierrepoilievre @pmharper how many of those jobs were for actual canadians and not temporary foreign workers
@pierrepoilievre so if the ndp win or you lose the majority you'll now know the real reason #billc51 a disgrace to magna carta
@pierrepoilievre @pmharper getting arrested because the dear leader doesn't like the saying on a t shirt puttin style

@pierrepoilievre hey daffy you and the rest of your conservative party is like a lawn your ass is grass and canadians are the mower cya
@pierrepoilievre let's see 7 consecutive deficits and 160 billion in new debt more on the way so that's responsible holy shit daffy
@pierrepoilievre you and chris alexander are quite the duo you think you can feed people horse shit and then convince us it tastes gooddone
@pierrepoilievre @nattremb_ belle campagne de dsinformation conservatrice comme d'habitude
@pierrepoilievre i wouldn't pop off about lackeys if i were harper's yapping lapdog as you clearly are @canadiancynic @adamsooley

@pierrepoilievre those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones how much has the cpc aded to our national debt
@pauldewar @acoyne @jkenney @calxandr yes the circumstances are tragic but extremely unfair to equate rejection to death of family
@pauldewar @matiasded @jkenney @calxandr your trying to gain political points over the death of an infant is #shameful #refugeecriss #elxn42
the globe editorial board notes @pauldewar @markbourrie @jkenney @calxandr
@pauldewar remember when canada refused 900 jewish #refugees they ended up dead #syriantoddler #cdnpoli #elxn42
@pauldewar @acoyne @jkenney @calxandr dirty politics as usual see @scott_gilmore
@pauldewar remember when canada refused 900 jewish #refugees then ended up dead #syrianboy #cdnpoli #elxn42
@pauldewar @acoyne @jkenney @calxandr yet you would do nothing to combat isis pull out rcaf and jtf2 i must say u have ur nerve
@pauldewar
@pauldewar @peggynashndp @ottawacitizen don't play politics maybe there was something in fathers past didn't pass smell test
@pauldewar @meganlesliehfx @ottawacitizen talk about the caper syrians
@pauldewar @jkenney @calxandr @acoyne negligence didn't #dewar wait 10 yrs for political timeing to bring atiwapiskat to world's attn
@pauldewar @scowen13 @jkenney @calxandr fyi @acoyne
@pauldewar @jkenney @calxandr chris alexander should suspend his whole political career for good #cdnpoli #elexn42 #resignalexander
@pauldewar @meganlesliehfx @ottawacitizen 6 syrians admitted under blended sponsorship program the crap is a sham
@pauldewar segment on pnp upsetting in so many ways grateful for sanity and intel from you @rosiebarton @johnmccallumlpc issue is urgent
@pauldewar paul fyiiceland caps syrian refugees at 50 10 000 icelanders respond by offering their homes
@pauldewar thanks for your efforts on @pnpcbc
@pauldewar great on @pnpcbc tonight telling @calxandr he lost all credibility #abouttime #ndp2015 #polcan
@pauldewar great job today on @pnpcbc
@pauldewar bringing in 65000 syrian refugees into canada equals 1 of all syrian refugees barely a dent would u really want that
@pauldewar you did a great job today on @pnpcbc #facepalm again thank you
@pauldewar i note that @calxandr repeatedly talks about relocation not immigration is this semantics or did canada bring in 10 000 iraqis
@pauldewar does the ndp support rights justice in palestine in the same way or are they different

@cathmckenna @liberal_party why are liberals selling out to corporations liberal tory same old story vote ndp
@cathmckenna @senatormunson chretien consorts with african tyrants he is being slammed on twitter for this asinine piece
@cathmckenna @billmilliken yeah and put some pepper on our steak
@cathmckenna @liberal_party let go guys
@cathmckenna @justintrudeau this hits home after reading it out loud my 10 year old said i never new canada was once a peaceful country
@cathmckenna#lpc @cafreeland once wished the lifeblood of southern ontario auto manufacturing went bankrupt
@cathmckenna @jackstar009 i forwarded the link to my kids it's required reading for all kids of their generation they need to know
@cathmckenna very sad to see how far we've fallen in last 10 yrs let's help to make canada a country that's world wide respected once again
@cathmckenna he highlighted how each of the pms of both stripes stood for what they believed would build a strong canada with world respect
@cathmckenna literally takes your breath away to see how far we've fallen chretien has highlighted roles of both former pc liberal pms
@cathmckenna yes it was

@cathmckenna @groundforcelive @samaracda a thanks
@cathmckenna @samaracda @rob_oliphant where is it this week
@cathmckenna @ohsheri1 @ruthmkb question is can org crime undercut the gov regulated prices cigarette black market does exist
@cathmckenna @ruthmkb so criminals not making money in black market for selling mj would save money on police court system tax revenue
@cathmckenna thanks
@cathmckenna @samaracda let's just say it is a work in progress crazy for cricket in #dvw once i figure out the rules
@cathmckenna @youthvote_ca totally agree educating the young will make voting a habit for life #samarachat
@cathmckenna @votecatherine i volunteer to be part of something bigger to affect change in how my country is run #samarachat
@cathmckenna @ruthmkb please dialogue re legalizing marijuana platform how much will legal mj undercut organized crime syndicates
@cathmckenna issues catch on w people who feel they are under attack for better or worse pot certain anti terrorism bill speak to that
@cathmckenna i will admit i like your energy
@cathmckenna my impression is politicians care but afraid to offend it's either crafted bold talking points or vague responses to direct q
@cathmckenna good discussion these youth would surely benefit from a copy of @genscrewedcdn's book
@cathmckenna sorry i totally usurped your discussion
@cathmckenna speaks to many of the issues that need to not be microtargeted but communicated as impt to all cdns #samarachat
@cathmckenna school to our first major jobs we often have transitional work i like to call it #samarachat 2 2
@cathmckenna @davidgourlay yet that's something we're not talking about how do we position our youth to compete in the new global paradigm
@cathmckenna and older people don't necessarily recognize the impact these issues have on the youth we can't always just walk out of 1 2
@cathmckenna @davidgourlay all they have to do is go to school get good grades and then they'll be poised to get a good job they won't
@cathmckenna @davidgourlay exactly we need a discussion on the future of work in this new economy we need to stop telling youth that
@cathmckenna worry about how these items will be funded will they be there for our future too relevant #samarachat 2 2
@cathmckenna but some of us are very interested in these issues because they affect our future our higher rates of unemployment make us 1 2
@cathmckenna why goofs like rob ford trump and renzi italy are popular at least they stand for something even if many don't agree 3 3
@cathmckenna had the same experience left me discouraged to the point of distancing myself from any political debate for the longest time
@cathmckenna politics cool what campus was this i want to visit it
@cathmckenna i emailed candidates and current officials on a policy issue two responded basically saying not my problem 2 3
@cathmckenna thanks more details at we hope @culiberals our other campus political groups will be there
@cathmckenna i'm not youth anymore but it still feels like candidates only care about getting elected and then to disappear for 3 5 yrs 1 3
@cathmckenna that is my point candidates must be creative in language social media tools to make youth interested we all benefit then
@cathmckenna candidates need to engage youth through comms in clearer language ie explain pension challenges aging healthcre #samarachat
@cathmckenna is there a role of canvassers to help inform #samarachat
@cathmckenna you better delete these tweets you don't want this scandal hitting the press #spellghazi
@cathmckenna zany way to spell a name eh
@cathmckenna i'm so sorry #gladihadboys
@cathmckenna move where
@cathmckenna @ruralbc @andrew_z_cohen @ottawacitizen insulting tweet from mulcair's director of communications
@cathmckenna awesome
@cathmckenna catching up looking fwd to having you if you rsvp will send you the report tmrw am
@cathmckenna hi catherine where would you need volunteers at what time thanks again kyle
@cathmckenna ill see what i can do
@cathmckenna i guess theres 8 months of campaigning to come id have a coffee sometime if youre free
@cathmckenna and loblaws can pay their fair share
@cathmckenna all that aside even if you could reduce payroll costs by a couple of percent thats immaterial to a small business
@cathmckenna theyll soon have to pay the ontario pension costs too and theyll suck it up or go under #marketforces
@cathmckenna too many people working at or below the poverty line while their employers whine to you about their business
@cathmckenna of course they say that i could complain to you about the taxes i pay
@cathmckenna were also facing the long term effects of having no or anemic pensions lots of hungry people in the future
@cathmckenna to reduce payroll costs will mean even more pressure to lower wages its not like savings on ei would go to staff
@cathmckenna ei surplusses are because weve cut support to the bone fewer days harder to be eligible etc
@cathmckenna cause cpc mp roxanne james ask y is cdn offering #refugees free education free medicare welfare cheque

@cathmckenna @ecologyottawa i saw my daughter's school elmdale go from gorgeous to awful thanks to mike harris
after a day of @justintrudeau lies this is best you got rt @cathmckenna hardly the average middle class guy he tries to portray #cdnpoli
@cathmckenna incum cons mp indicates that all fed money from can fund went to ott lrt and orap would lib govt help #ottcentraqllibrary
@cathmckenna ns province also chipped in for 13m halifax tax payer on the hook for the equivalent of local branch #ottcentrallibrary
@cathmckenna @opl_bpo project planning is exactly where an #architect voice needs to be heard
@cathmckenna @sarahottawa @bookmarkthecore even more critical how #architect will be selected use qbs to get quality best service
@cathmckenna jim wants a simple small central library in a claridge built box out in the flats he wont like people criticizing
@cathmckenna @niknanos some good pts from @vinodrjkn on exploring function opportunities orthodoxies re library
@cathmckenna @oldottsouth nerf war as the new electoral system better than first past the post
@cathmckenna @mspratt @oldottsouth not fair if spratt's in his kids are nerf gun marksmen and are training him
@cathmckenna thanks for sharing catherine mckenna have a great tuesday insight by
@cathmckenna nothing to wonder the ndp has committed to raise tax rate for large corporations
@cathmckenna and #lpc working to improve #ottawa need her in govt fighting to make capital city better #elxn42

@cathmckenna cbc has obtained documents re ndp infrastructure investment bc of balance promise infrastructure backdated for yrs @sas_robin
@cathmckenna fair enough i just wish progressives would work together and not tear each other down
@cathmckenna liberals suggesting ndp is imposing austerity is a little hypocritical and unfounded if you ask me thanks for engaging
@cathmckenna confused as to when the ndp announced cuts or raising taxes besides on corporations the super wealthy seems misleading
@cathmckenna @ottawacitizen i think the man lives in an alternate reality
@cathmckenna unfortunately that's a winning strategy for them outside of ottawa
@cathmckenna public servants are often an easy target for political parties in tough economic times it does backfire though ask tim hudak
@cathmckenna don't you live in a public servant town
@cathmckenna bill is hope and hard work 2 hrs out and he wants another poll he will be back tomorrow #lpc

@chandranepean promises that a liberal government would bring respect back to public service @pmharper has demoralized ps #cpc

@cathmckenna @njaved @zaib_shaikh thanks
@cathmckenna harper in league with mulcair to hurt trudeau in quebec
@cathmckenna appeal to quebec separatists and nationalists to consolidate que numbers was harper's old stock allusion for similar purpose
@cathmckenna and keep in mind pkp and a qb election in 2 years clarity couldn't be more crucial mulcair has no loyalty but to himself
@cathmckenna a bit of #oldstockaustralian no doubt #cdnpoli #nlpoli

@cathmckenna @1loriking @ivotejevote kevin played baseball and got an economics degree at queen's he was excellent at both
@cathmckenna tells audience at uottawa we need significant investments in infrastructure #cdnmuni
@cathmckenna @liberal_party need to have honest conversation about can's deficits investing and quality of life #cdnpoli
@cathmckenna @liberal_party if we don't allow for innovation we will not find solutions to urban problems #cdnpoli #innovation
@cathmckenna champlain bridge is a perfect example of a key infrastructure area where partnerships would be key
@cathmckenna how do we improve lives partnership between the federal govnt and local authorities to solve infrastructure deficits
@cathmckenna the @liberal_party will invest in municipalities and become a real partner with local governments

@pauldewar until the rules change your efforts will not help
@pauldewar @calxandr @marcgarneau since you are the foreign affairs immigration critics #cdnpoli
@pauldewar defended uccb for the rich would ndp restore universality to oas end clawback to be consistent #elxn42
at least @cathmckenna wore jogging suit politicking the #armyrun @pauldewar w son of refugee #ottawacentre #cdnpoli
distasteful making #armyrun political rt @pauldewar w philip @ #armyrun his father is 1 of 4000 vietnamese refugees #cdnpoli #ottawacentre
@pauldewar #oldstocksyrians
@pauldewar #bds #israeliaparthied #settlementsequalethniccleansingofpalestine
@pauldewar mulcair ndp supported passage of c51 by not voting for may's amendments to stop it
@pauldewar p3 that was the late 90's they refugees were sponsored not sure how easy it is to coordinate non sponsored refugees
@pauldewar p2 it took a lot of planning before we could bring over the kosovars then had to teach them life in canada english
@pauldewar i think it has to do with making sure that the refugees will have a place to stay my church sponsored kosovar refugees in 90's
@pauldewar yeah i question that as well and why only 10 000
@pauldewar unfortunately there is still the security boogeyman calling the shots and part of the cpc game plan cdn's know better #tm4pm
@pauldewar
@pauldewar shhhhhh don't let the cpc base know
@pauldewar

@pauldewar your pop culture reference for the night is dr zhivago
@pauldewar voted no to great programs like #uccb payments #incomesplitting for #seniors
@pauldewar claims that he has never been whipped in hoc #votefail on safety for #ottawacentre just for starters what else
@pauldewar @bearswim not as much red as when i was there
@pauldewar thank u for this canned answer @cathmckenna does social media engaging better but @votedamiancpc doesn't even bother 2 answer
@pauldewar agree with much of the party except way off on pro israeli stance that's not the ndp and never has been its neo conservatism
@pauldewar paul if the ndp ran deficit for even 2 years a lot of its strong platforms would become more realistic it seems to undermine
@pauldewar sorry my q was specifically related to bus foot commuters
@pauldewar @j8780 you're one of my fave mp's but this budget is unicorn fodder we don't have that money
@pauldewar any ideas on our to improve our lives
@pauldewar how about yemen with saudi us bombs pounding daily any children killed who killed serbian kids 12 years ago in kosovo

@pierrepoilievre @chevymo @bobrae48 #elxn42 #cdnpoli under a @thomasmulcair regime gt gt gt
@pierrepoilievre @manny_ottawa @bobrae48 who can trust a guy who jumped ships for power

@pierrepoilievre @waxman444 there you are
@pierrepoilievre that didn't answer @bobrae48 point whatever the liberals did 10 years ago doesn't excuse your govt's oversights #growup
@pierrepoilievre canadian taxpayers lost billions on tories' badly timed gm share sale
@pierrepoilievre what are you smiling about #elxn42
@pierrepoilievre @bobrae48 @littleshasta harper broke his promise and renegged on income trusts then went on to attack pensions #cdnpoli

@walterpamic @karenmccrimmon @johnhansenndp would you support fed levy on strip clubs that would go towards sexual assault services #elxn42
@walterpamic get your sign team back out to fix this classless move
@walterpamic this is mean immaturity is not leadership @pmharper tell candidates to grow up #elxn42 @justintrudeau

@cathmckenna so true glad you able to get away
@cathmckenna liberal bot must shut down for the evening will commence talking points after recharge beep boop
@cathmckenna please someone reprogram this liberal bot to actually answer questions
@cathmckenna @joeboughner i like the lib policy re short term deficits but am confused about reducing spending by 3b without cuts
@cathmckenna i never said you baked in job cuts i simply asked if any public servants you've talked to mentioned efficiencies sitting there
@cathmckenna @joeboughner you aren't presenting a choice that is better my friends are talking about picking candidate randomly to vote 4
@cathmckenna @joeboughner sorry catherine but this was spin legitimate liberal policy question yet you didn't answer it
@cathmckenna i've asked you one question and you haven't answered it you've bashed other parties instead so cynical politics
@cathmckenna @joeboughner many canadians are just not comfortable with deficits we had a big recession and deficits already why now
@cathmckenna @joeboughner and 3b in savings through program review right wasn't that the first question
@cathmckenna which i support but that's not what i asked about you keep telling me things i'm not arguing i asked one question
@cathmckenna at what point did i mention job cuts hashtagging the word fact doesn't actually address any of the questions i've asked
@cathmckenna you know i don't work for belong to or have any ties to ndp right i'm asking a basic question and you're giving me spin
@cathmckenna so you're not calling for 3 billion in savings from a program review
@cathmckenna i'm not sure why you're bringing up the ndp and cpc i asked a pretty straightforward question about your party's platform
@cathmckenna i'm referring to liberal costing that calls for 3 billion in savings via program review mccallum says there are efficiencies
@cathmckenna think 4million ppl w disabilities count in this election support #canadianswithdisabilitiesact#accessibility

@cathmckenna thank you for saying so i look forward to any other opinions or ideas you share regarding the public service #lpc #cdnpoli

@cathmckenna @mustangmadd #dipperssameascons
@cathmckenna we all need to do our part to educate voters especially new voters @_andrewleslie#supportourtroops#supportourveterans#lpc
@cathmckenna in fairness there isn't one #ndp caucus member that'd be qualified to be finmin no surprise the #cpc snowed them on finance
@cathmckenna that's rich coming from a flimsy costing that includes lines like help where it's needed most #ndp #fail
@cathmckenna @pnpcbc @bradlavigne #dishonestdippers
@cathmckenna it's fascinating to watch the #ndp try to criticize us for spending too much and not enough at the same time #elxn42 #cdnpoli
@cathmckenna but program cuts mean more public sector layoffs who will want to work for ps in ottawa w constant concern for job loss

@marlenerivier @stephenkobus @justintrudeau can u pls elaborate a little i don't understand
@marlenerivier @sheamuspatt what happened dear
@marlenerivier @thetyee @leadnow also from hill times the ship may have sailed for further ndp gains
@marlenerivier will put it in the calendar @anitavandenbeld @abdulabdi6 @markbrooksca cc @yalcrabm
@marlenerivier across the board federal budget cuts were necessary then and hit every dept continued cuts by cons are ideological
@marlenerivier free markets make lots of room for corruption of leaders connect the dots
@marlenerivier nafta might be a better starting point
@marlenerivier
@marlenerivier @thetyee @leadnow in a battle like #elxn42 the enemy of your enemy is your friend strategy tips

@marlenerivier @thetyee @leadnow electoral reform won't happen if return to con majority but is an issue sitting ndp's deliver coalition
@marlenerivier @thetyee @leadnow divide and conquer progressive votes is harpers tactic you don't need to win every battle to win the war

@abdulabdi6 how old do you need to be to volunteer #voteabdulabdi #abdulabdi #abdi
@abdulabdi6 it doesn't bother you that after all your dedication and hard work you can be stripped of citizenship in theory but not harper
@abdulabdi6 so by your explanation it is two tiered citizenship i and harper can do the same crime and only one of us loses his passport
@abdulabdi6 ok but do you see the problem with that i can lose my citizenship if i do that but mr harper never under c 24 can lose his
@abdulabdi6 these aren't facts my citizenship and yours can be stripped mr harper's can't how is that not two tiered and xenophobic
@abdulabdi6 so why can only dual citizens be terrorists whose citizenship can be stripped only immigrants want to cause harm #xenophobia

@votedamiancpc is the only choice for the people of ottawa centre with decades of experience he will keep taxes low for our citizens
@devinesean @janfromthebruce is nepean skippy's riding he needs to go
@devinesean @kathleenmonk of course they won't
@devinesean @andywang_ca can we really call it an all candidates debate sounds more like a candidates who care debate
@devinesean is that how you attract voters by insulting them when they ask questions about your public statements #nepeandeservesbetter
@devinesean @danieldickin the attached image might interest him
@devinesean so you're retracting your statement
@devinesean so are you standing by your impeaching obama statement
@devinesean your sign is down on strandherd across from the metro just wanted to let you know
@devinesean the last paragraph of that article may just sway me to vote ndp for the record i am a independent not a liberal
@emilietaman just wanted to report ndp campaign sign vandalism at the corner of donald and lola signs down at opposite corners
@emilietaman #arts connect us make for stronger communities how can we improve support for arts culture in ottawa vanier #artsvote
@emilietaman @jimwatsonottawa will the ever elusive con be there

@marlenerivier @tony_tracy not giving up your other citizenship made you a second class citizen
@marlenerivier @joelparkes @leadnowca mulcair falls to lowest level since becoming ndp leader
rh @pmharper hiding #usury and needs war with #muslims who understand the simple con it is such a dirty trick do the math @marlenerivier
@marlenerivier was the voice of #healthcare for the ndp perhaps our future minister of health #cdnpoli #ndp
@marlenerivier @techie_nurse @andrewtumilty imagine the hope pride in r country if he loses let's let r vote reflect r hopes not r fears
@marlenerivier diversity is cultural genocide #cdnpoli #onpoli #topoli
@marlenerivier congratulations
@marlenerivier @1proudcdn i see you marlene first in the fifth row of the #ndp women candidates photos #ownepean #nepean # #genderparity
@marlenerivier you're welcome marlene here's to getting you elected cheers
@marlenerivier @nenshi two thoughtful insightful people having a civilized convo on issues of great importance to canadians pshaww
@marlenerivier @torontogil manitoba ndp have a great record for running deficits tm admires selinger yet won't be seen publicly with him
@marlenerivier @torontogil i wouldn't expect you to recognize a changing world considering you can't recognize your leader is a nomad poli
@marlenerivier @torontogil canada and the lpc in 1995 is much different than canada and lpc in 2015 not apples to apples comparison
@marlenerivier @torontogil 4 deficit spending to spur a stagnant economy put people back to work by investing in needed infrastructure
@marlenerivier @torontogil 3 yet trudeau pledging to do opposite in different economic situation pledging support funding to health svcs
@marlenerivier @torontogil yet in 2 years back to balance debt reduction transfers increased incl 10 yr health accord w provinces 2
@marlenerivier @torontogil imf had canada bent over knee following mulroney moody's also substantially downgraded canada's credit rating 1
@marlenerivier @punnedit55 so after much due diligence research reading trudeau speaks what i support i have made an educated decision
@marlenerivier @punnedit55 2 2 petty nasty personal attacks don't resonate well with me i worked with guys like him for 40 years enough
@marlenerivier @punnedit55 i respect your choice of party because i deeply believe in free choice i had open mind to ndp but mulcair's 1 2
@marlenerivier @punnedit55 quit libs cuz he was demoted due to harrassement he was 'invited' to quit
@marlenerivier @punnedit55 tired of people not understanding implications of mulcair's no vote re c51 means it passes as is
@marlenerivier @punnedit55 fact demoted from charest's lib party and asked to leave fact cons said no to his salary request now with ndp
@marlenerivier @punnedit55 i said happy voting how is that wrong
@marlenerivier @punnedit55 and vice versa only reason you got mulcair fires from libs and rejected by cons he had no where else to go
@marlenerivier @punnedit55 happy voting we all have the right to our opinion
@marlenerivier @punnedit55 and in a riding where only the liberal can defeat the con
@marlenerivier @punnedit55 nope voting lpc mulcair harper
@marlenerivier @thomasmulcair 'note to self don't attack dead people' for mulcair
@marlenerivier progressives don't like posers your leader is a former liberal tried joining cpc now leading ndp running on cpc budget
@marlenerivier @torontogil was this the first failed roll out or the second failed roll out i can't tell #notom
@marlenerivier @torontogil jt spent well deserved break with his young family tm was floor mopped at munk needed more seclusion b4 debate
@marlenerivier @torontogil #twotonguedtom wasn't at 2 costings 1st was so awful they needed a 2nd crack at it both without him not good

@cathmckenna agreed pls let ndp voters know that they need to vote liberals to unseat harper avoid vote splitting
@cathmckenna @sabou35876529 this ties @pmharper directly to the death of #alankurdi #elxn42
@cathmckenna ottawa city council spending 23 million on social housing 26 million on bike lanes housing doesn't seem to be the priority
@cathmckenna combined with rent inflation it's a real social economic issue
@cathmckenna never in 22 years of practice have i heard of pmo involvement in routine cases
@cathmckenna yes everything should be free and none of us should have to be responsible for our own success #becausemakebelieveisfun
@cathmckenna harper has severely degraded our prison pardon system i've heard nothing from lpc on prison reform #prisonpolicy

@cathmckenna speaking at the albert school for continuing education this morning #elxn42 #realchangenow
@cathmckenna why do cpc even bother selecting candidates that won't talkperhaps they can have wooden dummies made up 2 run under cpc banner
@cathmckenna thank you

@cathmckenna @westenderba a lot of kids who didn't study the subject play hooky on exam day
@cathmckenna i think your team put my sign on my neighbour's lawn this could spell trouble
@cathmckenna that sounds like a challenge i'm calling the winnipeg ballet to see what i can arrange
@cathmckenna @poli_moose isn't it a shame the #cpc candidate can't face voters why would anyone want to vote #cpc disgusting behaviour

@cathmckenna @pauldewar @tommilroygpc @votedamiancpc devonshire ps students in ottawa centre send a message to all voters get out vote
@cathmckenna seriously this campaign will go down in history as the one where cpc was a no show at all debates
@cathmckenna @poli_nerd i saw at one meeting they put toy chicken with the cpc logo when the candidate didn't show
@cathmckenna @muskokamoneybag @pmharper and @cpc_hq act like they are entitled to lead w no respect for democratic process vote out harper
@cathmckenna so lame #cpc
@cathmckenna @muskokamoneybag can't remove gags 4 fear of referring 2 #c51 or #tpp 2 which they can't talk about
@cathmckenna you're welcome thanks for taking the time to talk afterwards

@votechris2015 hope and change
@votechris2015 what a team
@votechris2015 hey chris i've made my decision i'm voting for you i hope you oust that poilievre we need a local person representing us
@votechris2015 @liberal_party
@votechris2015 talking politics in class today and why elections are important guess who's riding i am in
@votedamiancpc have a look full time jobs lost
@votedamiancpc if your plan is to turn full time jobs into part time its working canada lost 62k full time jobs
@votedamiancpc well damian i hope that you didn't talk down to the young people kids @pauldewar @cathmckenna @studentvote
@votedamiancpc thank you
@votedamiancpc i requested a lawn sign through the #conservative web site over a week ago and still nothing could you help
@votedamiancpc @robertdekker too bad you couldn't have made it down to city hall
@votedamiancpc pls support future voters of ottawa centre rt vote for @wegowling in book contest #adoptgowling
@devinesean thanks for the rt sean
@devinesean we are working on a signature 'orange crush' drink for your big night any suggestions for what should be in it #elxn42 #ndp
@devinesean sent to your gmail account
@eleanorsibbert take a photo and email it to me please
@devinesean i mean the actual paper which we get every morning #oldschool
@devinesean plenty of opportunity for meaningful campaigns in every riding because every vote would count after harper out fptp gone
@devinesean people i talk to who want harper out worry that ndp liberal posturing will let harper come up the middle
@devinesean i hope that item 1 day 1 of an ndp lib entente would be how to move away from fptp but we need harper decisively gone first
@devinesean but there is a higher objective this election than just making a good show of the flag in a no hoper riding
@devinesean i understand it's honourable to stick with the fight and your core supporters would be disappointed
@devinesean ok but i showed you 2 different polls 1 projection and 1 something that all point to you not cracking 20
@devinesean all true but trust them more than harper but that's all rhetoric if lib doesn't win it's another tick in the blue column
@devinesean have to get harper out if any hope of some form of pr where all votes in all ridings would have at least some value#cdnpoli
@devinesean except under fptp they are wasted ndp or lib in most of ab really why bother voting same for con in nl or ns stay in bed
@devinesean need to make sure nepean is taken out of the blue column ndp can't do it it's clear time for a graceful retreat #cdnpoli
@devinesean pledge for electoral reform but more hope of it under ndp libs entente than with even another con minority
@devinesean 70 want harper out but current electoral system and culture may result in him staying in don't know if libs will honour
@devinesean this time is different we all know it non party people i know can't understand why ndp libs can't work out vote swaps
@devinesean but you know all this i'm a supporter i've worked winning campaigns no hopers usually u just hope to get your 10 #cdnpoli
@devinesean and the consensus on the electoral prediction project is that you are not a factor in nepean
@devinesean was projecting you at 14 8 yesterday
@devinesean @leadnowca had you at 19 in september
@devinesean but wang is poilievre's handpicked empty suit in his old riding where he had 10 years to curry favour #elxn42#cdnpoli
@devinesean the key thing in #elxn42 is #stopharper#cdnpoli@jordan_b_ross
@devinesean it's not personal under the present system most mps are just a 4 year long electoral college #elxn42#cdnpoli @jordan_b_ross
@devinesean your internal polling shows you have no hope simply not enough time for momentum #elxn42#cdnpoli
except in most cases they do @devinesean the @ottawacitizen poll shows you well outside margin of error #elxn42
@devinesean here's hoping
@devinesean i don't see him agreeing to that
@devinesean i hope you are right but i've seen this riding go their way in far too many elections you and arya splitting votes doesn't help
@devinesean don't know about polls but you seem like a solid dude hope you get it
@devinesean polls can be wrong but unless you or arya 'steal' 50 60 of the others votes wang wins easy frustrating
@devinesean i wish it were that easy i've voted ndp in this riding for years only to see my vote wasted i'm very conflicted here
@devinesean that's great i would like to see more orange on my street
@devinesean @votejeanluc @chandranepean @andywang_ca ty #nepeanriding candidates for an informative fun evening #elxn42 #ottpoli #cdnpoli
@devinesean i trust cullen and trudeau can get big things done
@devinesean i've lost all hope that @pierrepoilievre will do it
@devinesean which street
@devinesean @trendarlington @votejeanluc @chandranepean @andywang_ca i love the subtle snark in that first sentence
@devinesean just heard harper admit that the economy is fragile and therefore we should reelect him ever heard of anything so crazy
@devinesean where's @andywang_ca oh right he's door knocking
@devinesean @mkutney indeed it is the only thing that ever has
@devinesean @mkutney
@devinesean love to but if i did that with every candidate there would be no bulldog thx for offer though
@devinesean they must be going by the better to be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt bit#getridofharper
@devinesean glad to see all agreed that a new sens arena shouldn't get public money billionaires should pay for their own revenue drivers
@devinesean ha i spent my earliest years in bells corners good luck with the campaign sean
@devinesean if @andywang_ca does not want to participate in democracy we should oblige him on october 19 #elxn42 #barrhaven #disrespect
