# Using Data to Augment Gyeonggang Line Map

We saw the map of the Gyeonggang Line in Section \@ref(LineMap).  We can now augment it with additional information.

## Augmented Gyeonggang Line Map

The map will now include additional information about each station and the size of its marker represent the total number of passengers that arrive at the station.
